# Green Connect

A Flutter project.

## 1. Introduction

Our university has experienced significant growth in recent years, resulting in an increase in the number of students and staff. However, this expansion has presented challenges such as administrative inefficiencies, communication gaps, limited access to resources, and a lack of engagement in university events. These issues have a direct impact on the overall student and staff experience, hindering their ability to thrive within the university community. 

Through extensive research and consultations with the instructors, we have identified a range of challenges faced by students and staff alike. This proposal outlines a strategic approach to tackle these issues by using mobile app development techniques and incorporating best practices in user experience design. The app will act as a comprehensive tool, offering features such as streamlined administrative processes, access to academic resources, personalized notifications, campus news and events, interactive forums for collaboration, and much more. By bringing these elements together within a single, user-friendly interface, the app will serve as an invaluable resource for our university community, fostering better communication and collaboration, and creating an environment which conducive to personal growth and academic success.
